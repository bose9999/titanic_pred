# titanic_pred
This is a classic machine learning project which is used for predicting the survivability of passengers on the Titanic ship which determines wheteher a passenger drowned or survived in the crash based on the data provided by kaggle in their titanic pred competition,the link to which is "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data".

We perform the prediction suse=ing the logistic regression model and gain an accuracy score of 85% approx which can be further tuned.

The entire code can be divided into data preprocessing,data visualization,data exploration, the model , the prediction and finally the evaluation metrics.

We utilise python libraries like pandas numpy seaborn and scikit learn to help us perform and complete the task
